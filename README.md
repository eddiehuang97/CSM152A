# CS M152A: Digital Design Laboratory

## Background
I took this course during my second year at UCLA. It involves the use of a Xilinx Nexys3 Spartan-6 FPGA board, and the use of Verilog. The quarter consisted of five projects that included creating a floating point converter, stopwatch, and then a final creative project, in which our group decided to build an old-school video game.
